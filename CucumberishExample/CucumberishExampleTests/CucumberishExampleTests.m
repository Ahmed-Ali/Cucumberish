     Feature: Example

     As someone who plan to automate the iOS projet test cases, I will use Cucumberish.
     
     # First scenario is the scenario name, which will also appear in a proper formatting in the test navigator
     Scenario: First scenario
     # This is the first step in the scenario
     # Also noteworthy; a "Given" step, should be treated as the step the defines the app state before going into the rest of the scenario
     # Or consider it as a precondition for the scenario;
     # For example to post a comment, the user most be logged in, then you should say something similar to "Given the user is logged in" as your Given step.
     Given I have a very cool app
     
     # The grammar being used, is completely defined by you and your QA team; it is up to you to find the best way to define your functionality.
     # Only keep in mind that every step must start with "Given", "When", "Then", "And", and "But".
     When I automate it with "Cucumberish"
     Then I will be more confident about the quality of the project and its releases
