/**
 C function that registers a code block to be used to call the scenario execution block.
 Code blocks registerd with this function will receive to parameter: scenario instance and scenario execution block as a parameter.
 
 If more than one code block matches the scenario, you are still required to call the scenario execution from each registered code block. However, your scenario will be executed once as it is supposed to be.

 Matching against around blocks happens in FIFO (First In First Out) order; in case more than one block has matched the same scenario, then they are nested.
 
 @Note
 Failing to call the scenario execution block, will prevent the scenario from being executed.
 
 @b Example of more than one match
 
 There are three registerd blocks with tags that matches the same scenario, the followin nesting calls will happen:
 
 @code
Third Around Match
    Block = contains code block that executes the Second Around Match
        Second Around Match
            Block = contains code block that executes the First Around Match
                First Around Match
                    Block = A call Scenario Exection Block@endcode
 
 
 @Note
 Do not prefix any tag you pass with @@ symbol
 
 @Note
 This function should not be called after calling @a beginExecution.
 
 
 @param tags array of strings that will be used to match specific scenarios
 @param aroundScenarioBlock code block that will be executed for each scneario, this block receives an instance of the scenario and the scenario execution block.
