 Cucumberish is the main class you will need to parse your feature files and execute them.

/**
 As this being written, there is an issue with Xcode that causes the last scenario to disappear once it is done.
 If this causes an issue for your test report, change the value of this property to YES before calling beginExecution.
 
 @Note
 Thoguh the default value of this property is NO, it is highly recommended to set the value of this proeprty to YES.
 
 @Note
 This will cause Cucumberish to execute an additional scenario called cucumberishCleanupScenario which will immediately disappear instead of your real last scenario.
 Also this will increase the number of executed scenarios by 1. If you only have 6 scenarios, you will see 7 scenarios in the console message, and in your report navigator.
